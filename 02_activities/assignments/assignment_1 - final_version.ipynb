    "It wasn't necessary to convert to Pandas to calculate the moving average return. Doing it directly in Dask would have been better because Dask operates efficiently on large datasets that don't fit into memory. Dask's .rolling() and .mean() methods work similarly to Pandas but are optimized to handle distributed computing, allowing for scalable calculations across multiple cores or even clusters without the limitations of in-memory operations. This approach ensures better performance and scalability, especially when dealing with big data."
